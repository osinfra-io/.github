# Hi there - We are Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)👋

![osinfra.io logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1610100/201447635-064be8ae-23ee-47bf-8a80-39f8b1a23cd1.png)

We focus on the core fundamental practice of cloud engineering, Infrastructure as Code.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure** is the set of systems and underlying resources that serve an organization and encompasses the services necessary for its teams and applications to function.

The term "**as code**," means applying the relative lessons learned in the software world to infrastructure. Some critical practices include source control and clean code for readability, changeability, extensibility, and maintainability, along with automated testing and continuous delivery.

### Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)

Open Source Infrastructure (as code) is a development model for infrastructure that focuses on open collaboration and applying relative lessons learned from software development practices that organizations can use internally at scale.

### Platforms

Every organization is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all platform. Platforms continuously evolve and change based on your organizational requirements and the internal customers that consume them. The examples of Infrastructure as Code we provide are designed to spark ideas, help you invest in your people, and develop the necessary skills to improve your services.
