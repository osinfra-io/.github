# ⚒️ Hi there - We are Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)!

![osinfra.io logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1610100/201447635-064be8ae-23ee-47bf-8a80-39f8b1a23cd1.png)

We focus on the core fundamental practice of platform engineering, Infrastructure as Code.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure** is the set of systems and underlying resources that serve an organization and encompasses the services necessary for its teams and applications to function.

The term "**as code**," means applying the relative lessons learned in the software world to infrastructure. Some critical practices include source control and clean code for readability, changeability, extensibility, and maintainability, along with automated testing and continuous delivery.

## 🔩 Open Source Infrastructure (as Code)

We are infrastructure as code engineers providing vendor-light solutions that organizations can use at scale. We value collaboration and learning out loud. Our goal is to deliver simple, secure, and supportable foundations that invest in your people and prioritize long-term success over short-term gains.
